Hi <CUSTOMER NAME>,
 
Thank you for the information you provide in the previous email, it was everything that we needed.
 
I have just processed your RMA and you should be receiving an email about it soon.
 
Once your replacement part is received, would you confirm with me that the replacement is working, and your issue is resolved?
I will also be checking in <TIME FRAME> to see if you have any questions or need any further clarification.
